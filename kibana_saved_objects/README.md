# Kibana configuration exports

This will work with a Kibana in version greater or equals than 7.3.0.

The `*.ndjson` files can be directly export on the `saved objects` settings in Kibana administration.

The `timepickerranges.json` needs to be copy/paste on the `advanced settings > Time filter quick ranges`.
